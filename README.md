# Seinfield script Generator

## Description

This project is the third project of the _Deep Learning nanodegree_, schooled by **Udacity, Inc.** ([https://eu.udacity.com](https://eu.udacity.com/)), a for-profit educational organization offering massive open online courses.

The project objective is to provide a deep learning algorithm that can  **generate original and consistent TV scripts**  based on the American television sitcom  **Seinfeld**  ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld)): To achieve this objective a RNN (recurrent neural network) has been used and trained on the scripts of all of the episodes of the 9 seasons of the sitcom.

In this repository, you will find the following files and folders:

-   The file  _**seinfeld_script_generator.ipynb**_, the Jupyter Notebook which contains all the detailed and explained study, accompanied by the results obtained;
-   The file  _helper.py_, a small library of functions which main purpose is to manage the data and the generated model;
-   The file  _seinfeld_unittests.py_, a collection of unit tests for a wide array of functions written for the study;
-   The folder  _data_, which contains the data used to train the neural network;
-   The files george.txt, jerry.txt, elaine.txt, kramer.txt which are all fictional TV scripts generated by the deep learning model after training.

Finally, to conclude, respectively to the requirements, it can be said that the deep learning model built within this study has been constructed thanks to  **PyTorch**  ([https://pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/)), the deep learning framework mainly supported and developed by  **Facebook**  and its  **FAIR**  (Facebook AI Research) team ([https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/)).
